## 📌 About My Project

This project is developed for **CODTECH Internship Task-2**, focusing on advanced SQL data analysis.  
The goal of this task is to explore how real-world datasets can be analyzed using complex SQL features including:

- **Window functions** for ranking, running totals, and partition-based analysis  
- **Subqueries** for nested filtering and conditional logic  
- **CTEs** for readable and reusable query blocks  

Through this project, I learned:

- How to derive insights like highest salary, department-wise ranking, and work experience  
- How SQL can be used to analyze trends and patterns in an organization  
- How to write clean, efficient, and modular SQL queries
